## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!

- ðŸŒ± My roots - I'm a seasoned graphic designer with 25 years of experience in the creative industry. My journey has been rich with diverse projects, from branding and visual communication to multimedia design. I've had the pleasure of working on projects that span across various mediums, continually honing my skills and pushing the boundaries of design.

- ðŸ¤” Currently, I am embarking on an exciting new chapter in my career. I am expanding my horizons through the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. This transition from graphic design to software engineering is an exhilarating challenge, and I'm eager to leverage my extensive design background to create innovative and user-centered software solutions.

- ðŸ’» As I delve into this new field, I'm focusing on building a robust portfolio that bridges my design expertise with my newfound coding skills. The projects you'll find here are a testament to my growth and enthusiasm as I work on developing software that is not only functional but also visually compelling.

- ðŸ”­ Feel free to explore my repositories, and if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and designers!

- âš¡ Fun fact: My husband and I have 2 daughters, 14 and 2. As a Mom of a toddler and a teenager, I can handle anything! ðŸ¤ª

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. ðŸš€
